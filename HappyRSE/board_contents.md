# Work

* no need for code in publications -> no recognition by journals
* enjoy the dual aspects of SE & domain 
* SE results in creating a product which can be used again as analogy of paper citation
* evaluation
* no job security despite good software (download statistics, usage metrics)
* brain drain (negative feedback by loosing valuable collegues)

# Life

* sleep is needed (for problem perception)
* but don't take me out of the flow/zone (genuine joy/being in full control of everything)
* work life balance
   * changes at different times
   * transitions in balance are difficult
   * not always your choice
   * working at home   
* find your productive time and let other people at theirs
* pilates
* family
* hobbies
* long holidays
* coder dojo
* seminars
* part time (family) is difficult (lack of support)
* relaxing with/without computer
* open source community engagement
* leaving comfort zone
