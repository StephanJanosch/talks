* uncertainty
* missing feedback
* lack of recognition

## other

* Senior PI doesn't do reseach
* RSE write paper or might only do releases
* risk in joining a project
* re-start
* new avenues


# Work

* no need for code in publications -> no recognition by journals
* enjoy the dual aspects of SE & domain 
* SE results in creating a product which can be used again as analogy of paper citation
* evaluation
* no job security despite good software (download statistics, usage metrics)
* brain drain (negative feedback by loosing valuable collegues)
* travel is good, but exhausts - sometimes there is no budget at all, no travel because of code
* who is presenting my work? researchers at "their" conferences --> :-(
* like to show off my results
* like my projects because they're "unique and criticial
* freedom to decide project path
* trust in work
* evaluation by RSE (Researcher as stakeholder, not boss, makes **both** sides happy
* overcoming imposter syndrome
  * encourage openers
  * admitting we don't know
* balanced with ability to claim achievments
* importance of communication - shared understanding makes happy collaboration
* informal, collaborative management common (can cause problems)
* head of dpmt. unaware of RSE work
* good realtion ship with manager <-> multiple managers responsibilites
* team spirit
* autonomy/lack of management
* short term contracts

# Life

* sleep is needed (for problem perception)
* but don't take me out of the flow/zone (genuine joy/being in full control of everything)
* work life balance
   * changes at different times
   * transitions in balance are difficult
   * not always your choice
   * working at home   
* find your productive time and let other people at theirs
* pilates
* family
* hobbies
* long holidays
* coder dojo
* seminars
* part time (family) is difficult (lack of support)
* relaxing with/without computer
* open source community engagement
* leaving comfort zone

=============
* others taking/not sharing
* draining energy
* clarify in your roles in your team
* might be working on core, but not used/useful
* useful -> boring -> niched -> dead end
